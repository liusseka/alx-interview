N-Queens Challenge

This program solves the N-Queens problem, where the goal
is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard
such that no two queens threaten each other.
A queen can attack another queen if they share the
same row, column, or diagonal.

Usage:
    $ python3 nqueens.py N

Where:
    N (integer) is the size of the chessboard and the
    number of queens to place. The program will attempt to
    find all valid solutions where no two queens attack each other.

    - N must be an integer greater than or equal to 4.
    The N-Queens problem has no solution for
      values of N less than 4.

The solution prints all possible valid solutions in a list
format. Each solution is represented
as a list of coordinate pairs [row, column], where a queen
is placed at the corresponding (row, column) position.

Example:
    $ python3 nqueens.py 4
    [[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]]
    [[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]

This script uses a backtracking algorithm to explore
possible placements of queens row by row,
pruning invalid configurations as it goes.
